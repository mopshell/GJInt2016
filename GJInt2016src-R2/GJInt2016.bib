		  propagation of ultrasonic waves, can be used to
		  characterise the mechanical properties of structural
		  concrete in situ. The results obtained however are heavily
		  influenced by both water content and concrete mix design.
		  To overcome these biases, it is necessary to recalibrate
		  the results on a small number of cores, whose water content
		  has been laboratory-controlled. To this end, an
		  experimental device designed around the transmission of
		  bulk waves has been developed. The aim of this paper is to
		  introduce and describe such a device, which is able to take
		  into account specimen size, centre frequency and ease of
		  use. The studied mixes herein are composed of wet
		  shotcrete, dry shotcrete and concrete that has been formed
		  and manually set. Measurement results show the evolution in
		  wave velocities relative to four degrees of saturation.
		  Moreover, measurement uncertainties in the values of
		  velocities, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's
		  ratio are quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract	= {This paper analyzes why and how nondestructive testing
		  (NDT) measurements can be used in order to assess on site
		  strength of concrete. It is based on (a) an in-depth
		  critical review of existing models, (b) an analysis of
		  experimental data gathered by many authors in laboratory
		  studies as well as on site, (c) the development and
		  analysis of synthetic simulations designed in order to
		  reproduce the main patterns exhibited with real data while
		  better controlling influencing parameters. The key factors
		  influencing the quality of strength estimate are
		  identified. Two \{NDT\} techniques (UPV and rebound) are
		  prioritized and many empirical strength-NDT models are
		  analyzed. It is shown that the measurement error has a much
		  larger influence on the quality of estimate than the model
		  error. The key issue of calibration is addressed and a
		  proposal is made in the case of the SonReb combined
		  approach. It is based on the use of a prior double power
		  law model, with only one parameter to identify. The
		  analysis of real datasets from laboratory studies and from
		  real size buildings show that one can reach a root mean
		  square error (RMSE) on strength of about 4&#xa0;MPa.
		  Synthetic simulations are developed in order to better
		  understand the role played by the strength range and the
		  measurement error. They show that the number of calibration
		  cores can be significantly reduced without deteriorating
		  the quality of assessment. It is also shown that the
		  optimal calibration approach depends on the number of
		  cores. },

  abstract	= {A spectral element method for the approximate solution of
		  linear elastodynamic equations, set in a weak form, is
		  shown to provide an e cient tool for simulating elastic
		  wave propagation in realistic geological structures in two-
		  and three-dimensional geometries. The computational domain
		  is discretized into quadrangles, or hexahedra, deÿned with
		  respect to a reference unit domain by an invertible local
		  mapping. Inside each reference element, the numerical
		  integration is based on the tensor-product of a Gauss
		  –Lobatto –Legendre 1-D quadrature and the solution is
		  expanded onto a discrete polynomial basis using Lagrange
		  interpolants. As a result, the mass matrix is always
		  diagonal, which drastically reduces the computational cost
		  and allows an e cient parallel implementation. Absorbing
		  boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to
		  simulate unbounded physical domains. The time
		  discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving
		  scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit
		  predictor=multicorrector format. Long term energy
		  conservation and stability properties are illustrated as
		  well as the e ciency of the absorbing conditions. The
		  accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral
		  element results to numerical solutions of some classical
		  two-dimensional problems obtained by other methods. The
		  potentiality of the method is then illustrated by studying
		  a simple three-dimensional model. Very accurate modelling
		  of Rayleigh wave propagation and surface di raction is
		  obtained at a low computational cost. The method is shown
		  to provide an e cient tool to study the di raction of
		  elastic waves and the large ampliÿcation of ground motion
		  caused by three-dimensional surface topographies.},

  volume	= {270},
  abstract	= {This educational work presents a new approach towards
		  resonant interaction between classical light and matter.
		  The interaction between light and matter is considered from
		  three different points of view: the light picture (where
		  the material degrees of freedom have been integrated out,
		  and leaving one with scattering theory), the matter picture
		  (where the radiative degrees of freedom have been
		  eliminated and providing one essentially with atomic
		  physics). In addition the polariton approach is discussed,
		  in which the degrees of freedom of light and matter are
		  treated on the same footing. Although the first approach
		  will by far be given most of the attention, we will
		  frequently emphasize the equivalence of the three methods.
		  Much of the presented material is selfcontained. We
		  demonstrate that in the dynamical properties of multiple
		  scattering of light the “matter” properties play a
		  dominant role. Several “paradigms of atomic physics”
		  will be discussed from the view point of light scattering
		  theory. We shall introduce the far-reaching analogy between
		  the dielectric “Mie” sphere in classical optics, and
		  the two-level atom in semi-classical atomic physics. This
		  mapping turns out to be much more faithful than the widely
		  used analogy between scattering theory for De Broglie waves
		  and classical waves. In scattering theory the
		  semi-classical two-level atom is equivalent to a point
		  scatterer. },

  abstract	= {{In view of the importance of aggregate density to the
		  mechanical properties of concrete, it is necessary to
		  determine the aggregate density at any point in concrete or
		  any cross-section of a concrete element. Once the aggregate
		  density is known, some other mechanical properties of the
		  concrete can be determined based on the theory of
		  micro-mechanics. This paper attempts to simulate aggregate
		  distribution in plain concrete taking into account Of wall
		  effect. Based on the study of the characteristics of the
		  simulated aggregate distributions, a model of aggregate
		  density is developed and its statistics are derived.
		  Simulation results show that the average aggregate density
		  of concrete in both two and three dimensions converges
		  asymptotically to a constant when the number of simulations
		  tends to infinity. Using mathematical regression, the
		  aggregate density as a function of distance from the
		  boundary and the thickness of the boundary layers can be
		  expressed analytically in terms of the aggregate area or
		  volume fraction of the concrete. The experimental
		  verification of the developed model of aggregate density is
		  also presented in the paper.}},
