% ## INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}

% #### Nature and scope of the problem

\noindent Since the early developments of seismic imaging methods in the middle of 20th century, approaches and algorithms innovations are still proposed in current research projects. The improvements deal with both the qualitative imaging techniques like migration (e.g. \citet{Berkhout_MSS_2012,Guofeng_GPU_2013}), novel applications of quantitative imaging methods such as the first arrival tomography (e.g. \citet{Bohm_CWS_2015}), or even more recent approaches like the Full Waveform Inversion (e.g. \citet{Perez_AWI_2014}, see \citet{Virieux_FWI_2009} for a revue of this last decade). The refinements are proposed for different scales like near surface applications for civil engineering topics or more deeper investigation for example for oil prospection or crustal imaging at regional or global scales. They are mostly validated by using synthetic data, for example with well known shared benchmark (like the Marmousi case). However, the synthetic data are generally computed using the same wave propagation modeling engine used in the inverse problem process. In other terms, the synthetic data are computed with some assumptions which are the same in the inverse problem, for example the approximation of acoustic propagation, a 2D space medium, or a 2D line source. This approach, called \textit{inverse crime} \citep{Wirgin_TIC_2004} is particularly useful for validating an algorithm in its early development stage but does not take into account the artefacts that can be due to the assumptions of the direct problem. Some authors tackle this issue by providing 3D data which are inverted with a 2D approach or other restrictive assumptions (e.g ). But also in this case, the approach does not allow to assess the efficiency of the method for real seismic data. Moreover, because no one knows precisely the Earth interior, it is difficult to evaluate the capacity of a method to recover physical parameters and structures from real seismic data which can lead sometimes to geological misinterpretation due to numerical artifacts \citep{Morozov_ARF_2004}. Thus, it is necessary to add a step for which imaging methods will be tested for experimental seismic measurements obtained under controlled conditions.

\noindent The best way to satisfy this need is to use Physical Small Scale Modeling Methods (noted \psm subsequently). \psm were used since several years to study the propagation of waves in various media with several stage of complexity, from acoustic wave propagation in homogeneous media to elastic wave propagation in \thrd heterogeneous anisotropic media \citep{Rieber_EWP_1936,Howes_SMS_1953,Hilterman_TDM_1970,French_MRP_1974,Bishop_LVM_1985,Pratt_FWI_1999,Favretto_NMT_2013,Sarkar_TPM_2003,Isaac_SMS_1999}, and allow to generate experimental seismic data under well-controlled conditions. In this way, recent studies have been conducted to simulate multi-sources and multi-receivers through piezo-electric transducers \citep{Wong_SPM_2009}. An alternative approach consists in using the laser interferometry as the receiver system, as done in the MUSC Laboratory \citep{Bretaudeau_SSA_2008b,Bretaudeau_SSM_2011,Bretaudeau_FWI_2013}, \textit{Mesure Ultrasonore Sans Contact} in French. This technology, by avoiding the contact of the receivers on the model, allows to by-pass the coupling issue of transducers that is difficult to model. In this way, the MUSC laboratory is designed to simulate (1) wide-angle on-shore acquisitions modeling both body waves and surface waves, (2) automatic multisource-multireceiver measurements with a high-productivity, (3) high-precision source-receiver positioning and (4) high-precision recording of absolute surface displacement without coupling effects. 

\noindent These abilities have been validated through a comparison of experimental data to numerical simulation in a 2-dimensions space containing a cavity \citep{Bretaudeau_SSM_2011}. The results showed very fine similarities concerning the diffracted and converted arrivals when the source waveform is taken into account. For that, the numerical source was simulated in 2D and some corrections were required to compare the amplitude results, with some remaining weak discrepancies as mentioned in the discussion of \citep{Bretaudeau_SSM_2011}. Moreover, the source diagram was assessed with a parallel measurement bench, showing an omnidirectional propagation but the repeatability of the source impact was not studied.

% #### State the objectives
\noindent Our objective here is to increase the potential of the MUSC system as a reliable tool for generating experimental data which will be distributed in the scientific community. 
\noindent Thus, we present two studies of experimental data in order to : 1) quantitatively refine the comparison between numerical and experimental data by taking into account the 3D/2D geometrical spreading effects through an alternative way and 2) identify the reproducibility of the source impact and, consequently, data repeatability. These approaches will complete the knowledge of the system and facilitate the achievement of massive multi-source and multi-receiver data simulating subsurface seismic experimental campaigns. Moreover, they provide quantitative informations about the data quality for geophysicists who need to use them measurement based on reduced scale model. 

% #### Describe the method of investigation
\noindent In order to achieve these objectives, we used a seismic wave modeling code based on the Spectral Element Method \citep{Komatitsch_SEM_1998,Komatitsch_ISM_1999,Komatitsch_SEM_2005,Festa_PML_2005} that allows to provide numerical signals as reference data for comparison. The Spectral Element Method (SEM) has several advantages compared to finite differences and finite elements, such as: (1) a weak formulation which can naturally take into account the free surface, (2) an explicit scheme in time domain facilitating parallelization and reducing the computational cost, (3) a spatial discretization (mesh) convenient for the representation of complex environments and (4) high precision results and low numerical dispersion.

% #### Describe the principal results of the investigation

\noindent The numerical characteristics of the code used are described in a first part below. Afterwards, the specificities of the MUSC system are explained, followed by the presentation of the models used. Finally The two coupled studies on experimental data are detailed, in the respective aims (1) of refining the comparison between numerical and experimental data by taking into account the geometrical spreading effects between \twod and \thrd data through an alternative way, and (2) of identifying the reproducibility of the source impact to validate the data reproducibility.


% ## METHODS
\section{Methods}

% #### Spectral Element Method
\subsection{Numerical modeling: Spectral Element Method}

\noindent Various numerical methods exist to resolve the equation of motion in arbitrary elastic media. The most widely used for seismic applications is the Finite-Differences (FD) method \citep{Virieux_PSV_1986,Levander_PSV_1988,Robertsson_FDM_1994,Pratt_EWM_1990,Stekl_VEM_1998,Saenger_FDM_2004} which estimates each derivative on a regular Cartesian grid using a Taylor development \citep{Moczo_FDM_2004} of order \textit{n}. FD is simple to implement and robust but shows some limitations. First the Cartesian grid is defined by the minimum propagated wavelength ($\lambda_{min}$) in the full medium which conducts to a very small spatial step in case of low velocities zones as it is usually the case for subsurface issues. Moreover, \citet{Saenger_FDM_2000} show that 60 points by wavelength ($\lambda$) are needed to correctly model propagation of Rayleigh wave in order $n=2$ where only 15 points by $\lambda$ are required to correctly model propagation of body waves which increases drastically the numerical cost in case of near-surface modeling experiments. Second, the Cartesian grid does not provide a suitable tool to reproduce properly complex topography and interfaces. 

\noindent To overcome this limit, one can use the Finite-Elements Method (FEM) which is another popular method used for wave propagation modeling \citep{Lysmer_FEM_1972,Seron_FEM_1990,Hulbert_FEM_1990}. FEM is based on a variational formulation of the equation of motion and gives a continuous approximate solution in space using polynomial basis functions defined on each node of each cell of the mesh. The natural boundary conditions of FEM is the free surface and the triangular (in 2D) or tetraedric (in 3D) unstructured meshes are well adapted to complex media and topography. However, low polynomial basis are inadequate with fine spatial discretization and the required discretization to obtain precise and non-dispersive solution is numerically costly. 

\noindent Parallel, at the end of the 20th century, the Spectral Element Method (SEM), widely used in fluid dynamics \citep{Patera_SEM_1984,Korczak_SEM_1986,Karniadakis_FEM_1989}, has been adapted to seismic wave propagation \citep{Komatitsch_SEM_1998,Komatitsch_ISM_1999,Komatitsch_SEM_2005,Festa_PML_2005}. The SEM is a variant of FEM based on a high-order piecewise polynomial approximation of the weak formulation of the wave equation which leads to a spectral convergence ratio as the interpolation order increases. 

\noindent In this method, the wave-field is formulated in terms of high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and the integrals calculation are based on the quadrature of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (gll). This combination leads to a perfectly diagonal mass matrix which provides in turn a fully explicit time scheme suitable for numerical simulations on parallel computers.

\noindent SEM inherits the flexibility and the natural free surface condition of the FEM \citep{Tromp_SEM_2008}. The typical element size that is required to generate an accurate mesh is of the order of $\lambda$, $\lambda$ being the smallest wavelength of waves propagated in the model. In our study, the models are meshed with quadrangles (2D) and hexaedras (3D) using the open-source software package GMSH \citep{Geuzaine_MSH_2009}. It is particularly well suited to handle complex geometries and interface matching conditions \citep{Cristini_SEM_2012}. In order to simulate infinite or semi-infinite domain, SEM can use Perfect Match Layers boundary conditions \citep{Berenger_PML_1994,Festa_PML_2005}. However they are not used here because we simulate scale models which are spatially limited for the use in the MUSC system. The latter is described below in terms of technical specifications.


% #### MUSC bench
\subsection{Physical modeling: MUSC system}

\noindent The MUSC system \citep{Bretaudeau_SSA_2008b,Bretaudeau_SSM_2011,Bretaudeau_FWI_2013} is built to experimentally reproduce field seismic data with a great accuracy on reduceds scale model. Figure \ref{panel_musc_bench} shows the measurement bench and its components : it is composed of a honeycomb tab and two arms which control the source and the receiver positions with a precision of 10 $\mathrm{\mu m}$.

\noindent The receiving system of MUSC system is a laser interferometer based on a phase shift of the reflected laser signal due to the particular displacement at the surface of the model during the seismic waves propagation in the medium. An integrated real-time calibration system enables a continuous conversion to a quantitative measure of the particular displacement. The diameter of the laser beam on the model surface equals 20 micrometers for the focal distance of 40 mm and allows a detection of a vertical displacement of the order of the nanometer in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 20 MHz. The laser interferometer constitutes a non-coupled receiver which avoids the complicated modeling of the coupling effects on measurement.

\noindent But using a laser source needs more security protocols in the laboratory and up to now, the seismic source in the MUSC laboratory is simulated by a piezoelectric transducer linked to a launching and synchronization system. It allows to choose the source function, i.e., a waveform like a Gauss or Ricker function, the central frequency $f_{0}$ and the time delay $t_{0}$. For that, the source is generated by a waveform generator and is then amplified before being transmitted to the small-scale-model.

\noindent For the purpose of reduced scale modeling, the change of scale must keep the relationship between observables, i.e. amplitudes and time arrivals. Concerning the amplitude, the quality factor $Q$ will be chosen to be in the same range as the materials of near surface. For the time arrivals, the key parameter is the rate between the propagated seismic wavelength and the spatial dimensions of the experience that includes the model geometry, the spatial increment between the sources and the receivers positions, but also the dimensions of the source impact. In the framework of seismic physical modeling, this latter must be as close as possible to a point source in order to simulate the spatial energy repartition of a weight drop at the soil surface, i.e. with an isotropic directivity of the emitted P waves.

\noindent In the MUSC system, the main frequency bands used for reduced scale data are [ 20 KHz ; 200 KHz] and [ 300 KHz; 800 KHz], respectively called here "low frequency band" and" high frequency band". For the lower spectral band, a commercial piezo-electric transducer is used without any coupling gel. For the higher band, the piezoelectric source is coupled through a conical adapter which is sticked to the transducer in order to obtain the expected impact surface. The resulting source pattern is isotropic enough in the spectral band of interest (see \citep{Bretaudeau_SSM_2011} for more details).

\noindent The lower frequency band is well adapted to simulate seismic experiment applied to near surface through the scales ratios proposed in tables 1 and 2. In the first case (table 1), a central frequency of 100 KHz in the laboratory corresponds to a central frequency of 100 Hz on the field, whereas in the second one (table 2) a central frequency of 100 KHz in the laboratory corresponds to a central frequency of 50 HZ on the field. Note that with these propositions, the  quality factor $Q$ and the density $\rho$ are modeled with a ratio equal to 1, i.e. they remain the same at both of the scales. Actually small-scale models are generally made of thermoplastic or casting epoxy resin materials \citep{Bretaudeau_FWI_2013,Bretaudeau_SSM_2011,Bretaudeau_SSA_2008b}.The mechanical properties of these materials provide attenuation characteristics close to natural soil materials of subsurface media. Their seismic velocities are about 2 times of those in subsurface materials as proposed in table 2. The possibilities of combinations can generate the impedance contrasts encountered in the geophysical issues. 

\noindent The MUSC bench presented above has been studied for simulating with a great reproducibility the typical field campaigns of subsurface seismic measurement. The validation was achieved by comparison between small scale measurement and numerical data (ref). Results have shown a great reproducibility of the converted and diffracted events recorded on the vertical component. The amplitudes analysis had been conducted through 2D-3D corrections and small discrepancies remained due to the difficulty of taking into account the S and P waves in the same way. For this reason, we propose here to refine the study by testing a more recent correction methodology (ref) as well as providing experimental and numerical, 2D and 3D data. This study will be achieved through data carried out on two models that are presented below.


% ## Models
\subsection{Characteristics of the scale models tested}

\noindent In this study, we consider two different reduced scale models. The first one is homogeneous whereas the second one contains a deeper layer with a geometrical variation of the interface along the profile. The top layer, as well as the entire first model, is made of epoxy-resin called F50. The deeper layer is built with a more dense resin called LAB1000. The latter model is called Bialt. The specific properties of these two kind of resins are summarized in the table 3. As required, note that the Q-factor values are of the same order of the Q-factor value in the shallowest parts of the natural media.

\noindent As described in the previous part and proposed in table 2, it is possible to take into account a scale ratio equal to 2 for the velocities, and use a 100 KHz Ricker source in order to simulate a 50 Hz Ricker source in reality. This seems realistic for simulating an hammer impact on the soil. In this case, the distance scale ratio is 1000 such that a 1 mm distance in the laboratory experiment corresponds to a 1 m distance in reality. Following these rules, we propose different shot described in the following part. 

\noindent The recorded signals will be finely analyzed for a maximum offset equal to 60 mm in the case of the homogeneous model and 100 mm for the bialt model. Thus, the resin models have to be big enough in order to carry out this receiver-source distances without providing boundary echoes which could interfere with the direct arrivals. For that, the homogeneous model is 500 mm long and 504 mm large and 115 mm high. The Bialt model is 300 mm large and 200 mm high. The interface geometry is presented in figure 3. It simulates an interface between a 3 m thick layer of clay overcoming a limestone layer.

\noindent The numerical meshing required for numerical simulations involve dimensions of cells about … The resulting meshing structure for the bialt model is presented figure.
There is no PML in order to really simulate the reflexions due to the model boundaries.

\noindent These two resin blocks as well as their corresponding numerical models will be used for generating seismic data with punctual sources but also line sources in order to study the effective wavelet really emitted in the MUSC bench and its reproducibility as described in the two next parts.

\section{Results}

% #### From point-source to line-source acquisition
\subsection{From point-source to line-source response}

\noindent In the framework of wave propagation modeling and imaging methods, most of available algorithms are limited to the \twod approximation especially for computational cost causes. More, a widely used way to validate imaging methods consists in inverse crime while the validity of applications on real dataset is conditioned by strong \textit{a priori} and a weak knowledge of the target. All of these leads to a limited validation of the efficiency of imaging methods to recover parameter models. Thus, it is critical for \twod inversion of field data to accurately correct the difference between \twod and \thrd geometrical spreading.

\noindent Point-source data can be corrected from geometrical spreading using a simple two-steps signal processing: (1) convolving each trace by $\sqrt{t^{-1}}$, where $t$ is the time, to correct the phase shift of $\pi/4$ (2) applying a taper $\sqrt{t}$ to all traces to correct relative amplitudes. Some variation exist, for examples, using a linear source wavelet estimation method to correct the phase \citep{Bretaudeau_FWI_2013} or applying an offset conditioning to obtain a better correction of amplitudes \citep{Tran_SWT_2013}. To correct some biases of these methods, \citet{Forbriger_LSS_2014} and \citet{Schafer_LSS_2014} have introduced, and successfully applied to synthetic data, the \textit{hybrid method}. In the \textit{hybrid method} the geometrical spreading correction is conditioned by: (1) the offset, (2) the knowledge of the wave propagation velocities in the medium and (3) a user defined ratio used to smoothly correct amplitudes \textcolor{red}{from near offset, which used the direct wave correction, to far offsets, which used th single velocity correction}. This method is efficient but difficult to calibrate without reference data. Then, results are thus strongly dependent of user's \textit{a priori} and attempts. More, this kind of signal correction is mostly valid for one-dimensional medias, two-dimensional ($x,z$) medias with precautions, invariant along the $y$-axis.    

\noindent In other cases, 3D data are corrected or process \textit{on the fly}, or used as is in algorithm using a 2.5D approximation.

\noindent Thus, the missing step between purely numerical validation and real data applications can be the use of experimental line-source seismograms recorded under controlled conditions. Here, we take advantage of the experimental framework to explore an alternative approach specific to MUSC system. Figure \ref{amplitude_acqui_principle} presents a schematic representation of the principle for this kind of experiment composed of a finely-sampled line of point-source and a line of receiver for each considered offset. Theoretically, the weighted stack of all receiver with the same offset will results in a pseudo line-source response. Taking advantage of the reciprocity principle the experiment can be simplified by considering only one receiver per offset, on a line perpendicular and centered to the defined line-source. All traces of each common receiver gather are then stacked together to obtain the line-source response. In order to apply this protocol, we have to choose a line-source's length $L$ sufficiently great to be assimilated to a cylindrical source and above all a suitable sampling interval $\Delta s$ between each point-source constituting the pseudo line-source to ensure applicability of the \textit{Huygen's principle}. 

\noindent For this experiment, we choose the homogeneous block of \textit{F50 pure} epoxy-resin. Given the material's properties, we choose $L=240\ mm$ and $ds=0.5\ mm$ which leads to 481 point-source locations. Four receiver positions have been selected: 45, 50, 55 and 60 mm offset. The source wavelet is a Ricker with a central frequency $f_{0}=100\ kHz$ and $t_{0}=0.03\ ms$. Figures \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(a,c) show the signal recorded at one receiver for a line of point-sources and for both \twod and \thrd numerical modeling (figure \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(a)) and experimental modeling (figure \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(b)). Note that the quality factor is not took into account for the numerical modeling. The numerical result (fig \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(a)) clearly shows the different attempted P and S wavefronts and the reflected PP and P-SV wavefronts while for the experimental result, the $PP$-reflected wavefront is altered by the echo of the experimental source (which will be considered in the next section). Here, the point-source response corresponds to the central trace (distance $0\ mm$) and the equivalent line-source response is the weighted stack of all traces. Comparisons of the point-source and line-source responses are presented in figures \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(b) and \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(d), respectively for numerical and experimental modeling. For numerical modeling, we provide a line-source response from \twod modeling in comparison of both \thrd and weighted stack results. Note that traces are here normalized to be comparable. These comparisons show clearly the attempted phase shift of $\pi/4$ between point-source and line-source responses, and some differences in terms of waveform, especially for the experimental results between $0.08$ and $0.10\ ms$. More, the response from \twod modeling perfectly fit the weighted stack result \textcolor{red}{appart} from $0.18\ ms$ to the end of the time window where the PSv wave amplitude is abnormally high. This effect can be related to limited dimensions in time and space of the original \thrd signal.

\noindent The same comparisons, for the four source-receiver offsets, are shown in figures \ref{panel_amplitude_sem}(a) and \ref{panel_amplitude_sem}(b) for numerical modeling and experimental modeling, respectively. To validate our approach to produce experimental line-source responses, we have applied and calibrated the \textit{hybrid method} \citep{Forbriger_LSS_2014,Schafer_LSS_2014} on the numerical point-source response to obtain the equivalent line-source response. Figure \ref{panel_amplitude_sem}(b) presents the comparison between numerical line-source response and equivalent line-source response and shows that the \textit{hybrid method} is able to produce the equivalent line-source response with a very good agreement in terms of both phase and amplitude for P and S -waves but not for PP and PSv reflected waves. Finally, we have applied the correction with the same calibration to the experimental signal (figure \ref{panel_amplitude_sem}(d)). This last result shows a good agreement between experimental line-source and equivalent line-source responses up to $0.12\ ms$. Then, the correction of the geometrical spreading seems unable to scale correctly amplitude where echo of the source and reflected wave are superimposed. For the signal at $55\ mm$ offset, the largest amplitude difference can be explain by a weaker \textit{signal-to-noise} ratio than for the the three other offsets in the experimental data.  

\noindent These results on our approach to generate experimental line-source responses show that the MUSC system is efficient and can produce reliable 2D experimental data suitable for migration-based methods such as FWI.


% #### Experimental source reproducibility
\subsection{Experimental source reproducibility}

\noindent We have shown the MUSC system is able to generate high quality 2D experimental seismograms. However, experimental data, as other, must be reproducible to be used as a reference or in an inversion process. As shown by \citet{Bretaudeau_SSM_2011}, the source waveform injected in the reduced-scale model by the piezo-electric source is not similar to the selected theoretical one. Figure \ref{amplitude_stack_principle}(c), in previous section, shows clearly multiple wavefront following the main $P$-wave and, particulary, $S$-wave wavefronts. After \citet{Bretaudeau_SSM_2011}, these multiples are generated inside the conical adapter of the piezo-electric source before being injected in the model. This naturally raises question about the ability of MUSC system to provide reproducible data. To evaluate the reproducibility of the source impact, several physical modeling were performed on the same \textit{F50 pure} homogeneous epoxy-resin block as in previous section. 

\noindent In a first step, ten realizations have been acquired on this model with a similar geometry setup: 120 receivers positions with an increment $\Delta r= 1\ mm$ and a minimum source-receiver offset of $o=10\ mm$. The numerical wavelet sent to the piezoelectric transducer source is a Ricker function with a central frequency of $100\ kHz$. Figure \ref{panel_central_traces_cc}(a) shows the resulting central trace ($o=70\ mm$) of each realization and \textbf{cc} gives the correlation coefficient of each trace with a mean signal calculated using central trace of each of the ten experiments (figure \ref{panel_central_traces_cc}(b)). For each realization, \textbf{cc} is always greater than 0.98 which demonstrate the very high reproducibility of data generated by the MUSC system.

\noindent In a second step, a unique source wavelet is estimated using a linear source wavelet estimation method based on a stabilized deconvolution \citep{Pratt_FWI_1999}. The source wavelet estimation takes into account the vertical components of the ten experiments together and allows to obtain a mean effective source wavelet (figure \ref{panel_srcest_2d_mean_comp}(a)). The resulting source wavelet is applied to the synthetic signals (figure \ref{panel_srcest_2d_mean_comp}(b)). The corrected seismograms are in good agreement with the experimental seismograms (correlation coefficients $\mathrm{>}$ 0.96) confirms the great efficiency of the wavelet source assessment process.  

\noindent These last results, based on an average estimated source wavelet show that the effective impulse source emitted by the transducer in the MUSC system measurement bench is stable enough to ensure a robust reproducibility of the source. Therefore, concerning the key issue of the source knowledge, experimental data acquired in the MUSC system can be efficiently processed by imaging methods like Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) with only one estimation step for all the multi-source and multi-receivers data.

\noindent However, this last result does not mean that the source will be the same for an experiment for an other experiment on an other model. Thus, we consider now a more complex model, called \textit{BiAlt} (figure \ref{panel_bialt_model}. We generate synthetic seismogram with the 2D SEM algorithm and using the mean effective source wavelet estimated on homogeneous block as a source function. Figure \ref{blind-test} shows that the synthetic seismogram using the effective source wavelet is in good agreement with the experimental one...

\noindent This last result shows that the MUSC source is stable from an experiment to an other and can be consequently injected as an input in modeling and imaging methods without any pre-processing or \textit{on the fly} source inversion.

% ## CONCLUSIONS

\section{Conclusions}

\noindent These two studies allow to refine the capacity of the physical modeling designed for seismic experiments simulation by 1) completing the validation of the measurement through comparison of numerical and experimental data generated by a realistic 2D source line and 2) assessing the reproductivity of the effective source emitted in a model. These improvements allow to provide and distribute experimental reduced scale data to the scientific community as benchmark datasets.
