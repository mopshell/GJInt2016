  Abstract                 = {{Various non-destructive testing methods, based on the
 propagation of ultrasonic waves, can be used to
 characterise the mechanical properties of structural
 concrete in situ. The results obtained however are heavily
 influenced by both water content and concrete mix design.
 To overcome these biases, it is necessary to recalibrate
 the results on a small number of cores, whose water content
 has been laboratory-controlled. To this end, an
 experimental device designed around the transmission of
 bulk waves has been developed. The aim of this paper is to
 introduce and describe such a device, which is able to take
 into account specimen size, centre frequency and ease of
 use. The studied mixes herein are composed of wet
 shotcrete, dry shotcrete and concrete that has been formed
 and manually set. Measurement results show the evolution in
 wave velocities relative to four degrees of saturation.
 Moreover, measurement uncertainties in the values of
 velocities, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's
 ratio are quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes why and how nondestructive testing
 (NDT) measurements can be used in order to assess on site
 strength of concrete. It is based on (a) an in-depth
 critical review of existing models, (b) an analysis of
 experimental data gathered by many authors in laboratory
 studies as well as on site, (c) the development and
 analysis of synthetic simulations designed in order to
 reproduce the main patterns exhibited with real data while
 better controlling influencing parameters. The key factors
 influencing the quality of strength estimate are
 identified. Two \{NDT\} techniques (UPV and rebound) are
 prioritized and many empirical strength-NDT models are
 analyzed. It is shown that the measurement error has a much
 larger influence on the quality of estimate than the model
 error. The key issue of calibration is addressed and a
 proposal is made in the case of the SonReb combined
 approach. It is based on the use of a prior double power
 law model, with only one parameter to identify. The
 analysis of real datasets from laboratory studies and from
 real size buildings show that one can reach a root mean
 square error (RMSE) on strength of about 4&#xa0;MPa.
 Synthetic simulations are developed in order to better
 understand the role played by the strength range and the
 measurement error. They show that the number of calibration
 cores can be significantly reduced without deteriorating
 the quality of assessment. It is also shown that the
 optimal calibration approach depends on the number of
 cores. },

 concrete and mortar in the frequency range
 60–180&#xa0;kHz. At these frequencies, the wavelength is
 comparable to the size of the aggregates, and waves
 propagate in a multiple scattering regime. Acquired signals
 are then difficult to interpret due to an important
 incoherent part. The method proposed here is the study of
 the coherent waves, obtained by averaging signals over
 several configurations of disorder. Coherent waves give
 information on an equivalent homogeneous medium. To acquire
 a large amount of measurements with accuracy, an optimised
 piezoelectric source is used with a laser interferometer
 for reception. Adapted signal processing technique are
 presented to evaluate the coherent phase and group
 velocities and also the coherent attenuation parameter. The
 sensitivity of these three parameters with the properties
 of concrete is discussed, as well as the necessity to use
 coherent waves to obtain accurate results.},

  Abstract                 = {This work aims at developing a numerical tool to model 3D
 seismic waves propagation in complex geological media where
 site effects prevail. The spectral element method (SEM) is
 particularly well adapted to the site effects modeling
 problematic : accurate surface waves evaluation, ability to
 handle complex geometries (free surface topography,
 interfaces) and the possibility of adapting the wavelengths
 resolution in heterogeneous media conditions with
 unstructured meshes. Numerical extensions of the SEM linked
 with the basin response were developed : filtering
 Perfectly Matched Layers and efficient introduction of an
 incident wave field. This 3D code was implemented with an
 object orientation to facilitate its parallelization,
 ensure a greater modularity and handle unstructured meshes.
 Currently, the principal limitation of the SEM comes,
 however, from the lack of flexibility of hexahedral meshes,
 despite the use of unstructured meshes whose generation
 remains a complex task. This work emphasizes the
 difficulties linked with the handling of such structures
 and describes the complete process for the modeling of the
 seismic response in complex geological media, from the
 physical and numerical model elaboration through to the
 results analysis. We present here 3D simulations of the
 seismic response in the Caracas area (Venezuela), including
 the 3D geometry of the basin and the Ávila barrier which
 borders the city. Data were supplied by the FUNVISIS agency
 (ECOS-Nord project). The importance of the effects linked
 with these two types of structures is assessed with
 different scenarios of plane wave excitation. These 3D
 geometrical effects reveal complex amplification phenomena
 associated with the reflection and the focalisation of
 waves propagating in all directions, and with the
 generation of surface waves at the edge and in narrowing
 areas of the basin. A comparison with 2D simulations shows
 the interest of 3D modeling : clear differences in terms of
 residency time and energy and amplification level were
 exhibited.}

  Abstract                 = {Perfectly matched layers (PMLs) provide an exponential
 decay, independent of the frequency, of any propagating
 field along an assigned direction without producing
 spurious reflections at the interface with the elastic
 volume. For this reason PMLs have been applied as absorbing
 boundary conditions (ABCs) and their efficiency in
 attenuating outgoing wave fields on the outskirts of
 numerical grids is more and more recognized. However, PMLs
 are designed for first-order differential equations and a
 natural extension to second-order Partial Differential
 Equations (PDEs) involves either additional variables in
 the time evolution scheme or convolutional operations. Both
 techniques are computationally expensive when implemented
 in a spectral element (SE) code and other ABCs (e.g.
 paraxial or standard sponge methods) still remain more
 attractive than PMLs. Here, an efficient second-order
 implementation of PMLs for SE is developed from
 interpreting the Newmark scheme as a time-staggered
 velocity–stress algorithm. The discrete equivalence with
 the standard scheme is based on an L 2 approximation of the
 stress field, with the same polynomial order as the
 velocity. In this case, PMLs can be introduced as for
 first-order equations preserving the natural second-order
 time stepping. Subsequently, a non-classical
 frequency-dependent perfectly matched layer is introduced
 by moving the pole of the stretching along the imaginary
 axis. In this case, the absorption depends on the frequency
 and the layer switches from a transparent behaviour at low
 frequencies to a uniform absorption as the frequency goes
 to infinity. It turns out to be more efficient than
 classical PMLs in the absorption of the incident waves, as
 the grazing incidence approaches, at the cost of a memory
 variable for any split component. Finally, an extension of
 PMLs to general curvilinear coordinates is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {A spectral element method for the approximate solution of
 linear elastodynamic equations, set in a weak form, is
 shown to provide an e cient tool for simulating elastic
 wave propagation in realistic geological structures in two-
 and three-dimensional geometries. The computational domain
 is discretized into quadrangles, or hexahedra, deÿned with
 respect to a reference unit domain by an invertible local
 mapping. Inside each reference element, the numerical
 integration is based on the tensor-product of a Gauss
 –Lobatto –Legendre 1-D quadrature and the solution is
 expanded onto a discrete polynomial basis using Lagrange
 interpolants. As a result, the mass matrix is always
 diagonal, which drastically reduces the computational cost
 and allows an e cient parallel implementation. Absorbing
 boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to
 simulate unbounded physical domains. The time
 discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving
 scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit
 predictor=multicorrector format. Long term energy
 conservation and stability properties are illustrated as
 well as the e ciency of the absorbing conditions. The
 accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral
 element results to numerical solutions of some classical
 two-dimensional problems obtained by other methods. The
 potentiality of the method is then illustrated by studying
 a simple three-dimensional model. Very accurate modelling
 of Rayleigh wave propagation and surface di raction is
 obtained at a low computational cost. The method is shown
 to provide an e cient tool to study the di raction of
 elastic waves and the large ampliÿcation of ground motion
 caused by three-dimensional surface topographies.},

  Abstract                 = {This educational work presents a new approach towards
 resonant interaction between classical light and matter.
 The interaction between light and matter is considered from
 three different points of view: the light picture (where
 the material degrees of freedom have been integrated out,
 and leaving one with scattering theory), the matter picture
 (where the radiative degrees of freedom have been
 eliminated and providing one essentially with atomic
 physics). In addition the polariton approach is discussed,
 in which the degrees of freedom of light and matter are
 treated on the same footing. Although the first approach
 will by far be given most of the attention, we will
 frequently emphasize the equivalence of the three methods.
 Much of the presented material is selfcontained. We
 demonstrate that in the dynamical properties of multiple
 scattering of light the “matter” properties play a
 dominant role. Several “paradigms of atomic physics”
 will be discussed from the view point of light scattering
 theory. We shall introduce the far-reaching analogy between
 the dielectric “Mie” sphere in classical optics, and
 the two-level atom in semi-classical atomic physics. This
 mapping turns out to be much more faithful than the widely
 used analogy between scattering theory for De Broglie waves
 and classical waves. In scattering theory the
 semi-classical two-level atom is equivalent to a point
 scatterer. },

 waves (MASW) with cross-correlation computed for every

 cross-correlations, that contain information on the
 location of noise sources, clean the dispersion diagram
 that would be obtain from passive MASW alone, by removing
 artifacts due to the ambiguity between source location and
 wave velocity in the beamforming process. The prposed
 method is tested with synthetic records computed for
 various configurations of array geometry and noise
 distribution. It is then applied on passive recordings
 performed along a sea dike, and surface-wave velocities
 that favorably compare with the ones obtained with hammer
 shots are retrieved from ambient vibrations generated by
 sea waves, in a larger frequency band.},

  Abstract                 = {{In view of the importance of aggregate density to the
 mechanical properties of concrete, it is necessary to
 determine the aggregate density at any point in concrete or
 any cross-section of a concrete element. Once the aggregate
 density is known, some other mechanical properties of the
 concrete can be determined based on the theory of
 micro-mechanics. This paper attempts to simulate aggregate
 distribution in plain concrete taking into account Of wall
 effect. Based on the study of the characteristics of the
 simulated aggregate distributions, a model of aggregate
 density is developed and its statistics are derived.
 Simulation results show that the average aggregate density
 of concrete in both two and three dimensions converges
 asymptotically to a constant when the number of simulations
 tends to infinity. Using mathematical regression, the
 aggregate density as a function of distance from the
 boundary and the thickness of the boundary layers can be
 expressed analytically in terms of the aggregate area or
 volume fraction of the concrete. The experimental
 verification of the developed model of aggregate density is
 also presented in the paper.}},
